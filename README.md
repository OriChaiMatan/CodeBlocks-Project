# Coding App
## Overview
This project is a Code Collaboration App that allows multiple users to interact with code blocks in real-time. The app supports a mentor-student dynamic, where the mentor can see the code block in read-only mode while students can edit the code. The app features real-time code synchronization, role management, and a solution checker.
